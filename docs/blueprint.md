## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333333) to ensure good contrast on e-ink displays, reminiscent of Windows 95.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) to simulate a paper-like appearance, close to the e-ink look and Windows 95 aesthetic.
- Accent color: Slightly darker gray (#666666) for selected cards and interactive elements to differentiate them from the background but keep it easy on the eye, in line with Windows 95 style
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text to give a simple, clear look for an e-ink display, similar to the fonts used in Windows 95.
- Simple, outline-style icons for menus and settings to minimize visual clutter on the e-ink display, mirroring the simplicity of Windows 95 icons.
- A clean and straightforward layout, using high-contrast cards to optimize visibility on e-ink screens, replicating the layout of Windows 95 Solitaire.
- Use simple fades for UI feedback events (card highlight on tap), reminiscent of the subtle animations in Windows 95.
